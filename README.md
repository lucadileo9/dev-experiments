# Dev Experiments

Personal sandbox for experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and programming concepts.

## Description

This repository is my practical learning space - a collection of projects and experiments built to explore different technologies, test new ideas, and learn by doing. You won't find production-ready projects or complete applications meant for real-world use here, but rather technical proofs, exercises, and prototypes created with the goal of understanding how things work under the hood.

Each project represents a learning opportunity: it could be a course I followed, a framework to explore, an algorithmic problem to solve, or simply a technical curiosity to satisfy.

**Note**: These projects are intentionally kept separate from my main portfolio. They are works-in-progress, experiments, and trials that document my continuous learning journey, not polished showcases of my skills.

## Projects

- **devops-capstone-project** - IBM DevOps capstone project with CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes deployment, and Tekton workflows, done during my IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera
- **distributed_algorithms_exercises** - University exercises on distributed algorithms: TCP socket programming and RMI
- **matrix-next-theme** - Experiment to create a Matrix-inspired visual theme using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- **mcp-first-try** - First test with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **next-simple-blog** - Minimalist blog built with Next.js to learn routing, database integration, and authentication
- **quasar-demo** - Quasar framework demo to explore Vue.js and component-based development
- **react-app** - React playground to experiment with hooks, state management, and component patterns
- **smt** - Automated reasoning and SMT solving exercises with Z3 solver

*Each project has its own README with specific details about objectives, technologies used, and setup.*
